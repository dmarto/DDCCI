DDCCI
========
DDC/CI library for Haskell

**DISCLAIMER** \
This is far from something that you can rely on for serious work.
Wanted to remake my LLCDaemon into Haskell, and this is part of the end
result. If you are looking for something more serious, check
[ddcutil](https://www.ddcutil.com/) and
[ddccontrol](https://github.com/ddccontrol). If you are brave enough
embed it into your xmonad and send me a screen shot :wink:


### TODO:
 - [ ] example for brightness control
 - [ ] README/Doc
